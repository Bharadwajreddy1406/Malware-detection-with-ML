#CyPHER: Network Analysis using Machine Learning

Overview
CyPHER is a network analysis tool developed by second-year students of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). This project serves as an educational endeavor, providing practical experience and application of theoretical knowledge within the scope of the academic curriculum and research conducted to date. Please note that CyPHER is not intended to be a comprehensive application but rather a learning exercise.

Features
Robust network traffic analysis
Detection of potential threats, including DDoS, SSH, Web attacks, BotNet, Infiltration, and Heartbleed
Real-time analysis of network traffic every ten minutes
Detection of newly connected external drives with optional scanning
Usage
1. Installation
Access the Download Page:
Scroll down on our website until you find the "Download for Windows â†“" button. Click on the button to initiate the download of a zip file. Alternatively, download the zip file from GitHub.

2. Extract Files:
After downloading, extract the contents of the zip file. Locate the executable file named cypher_py.exe, which serves as the main program.

3. Install WinPcap:
In the extracted files, find the WinPcap_4_1_3.exe file. Execute this file to launch the installation wizard for WinPcap. Follow the instructions provided by the wizard to complete the installation of WinPcap.

4. Configure Java Runtime Environment:
Before using the main software, ensure that the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) variable is set up on your system. Follow the steps provided in the installation guide.

Verify JRE Installation
Access Environment Variables
Add Java Installation Path to PATH
Verify Configuration
Execution
Execute cypher_py.exe to launch the application. The software initiates a packet sniffing phase for 60 seconds every ten minutes. The collected data is processed through an API hosted on a complimentary server. Real-time analysis can be stopped by clicking on "Stop real-time analysis."

Workflow
1. Packet Capture:
Using the scapy module, CyPHER captures packets for a specified duration (e.g., 60 seconds). It interacts with the OS kernel to set up packet capture, primarily interacting with the Data-Link Layer and Network Layer considering the OSI model.

2. Packet Parsing and File Conversion:
The captured packets are parsed, extracting necessary information. The parsed data is then saved to a file in the libpcap format, converting the list of Packet Objects to a pcap file.

3. Flow Analysis with CICFlowMeter:
CICFlowMeter is used for feature extraction. It analyzes the pcap file, creating bidirectional flows representing communication between two endpoints. The CSV generated by CICFlowMeter is converted into a pandas DataFrame.

4. Machine Learning Prediction:
The DataFrame undergoes analysis and prediction by a pre-trained machine learning model.

5. Disclaimer
This project is an educational exercise and may not attain the standards or functionality associated with a fully developed application.
